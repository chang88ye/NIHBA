# Network-Interdiction-for-Strain-Desgin
strain design using the concept of network interdiction and solved by a hybrid benders decomposition algorithm

NIHBA is fully compatible with Cobratoolbox 3.0 which is a matlab platform to metabolic network analysis.
Ecoli_gene_essentiality provides a list of  genes  ensential for the survival of E coli. If another microorganism is used,
this file can be removed or replaced with the corresponding essential genes.

To run NIHBA, just simply download a genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) from the bigg database: http://bigg.ucsd.edu/
